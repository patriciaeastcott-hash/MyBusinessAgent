    <h1>Australian Small Business Pulse: October 2025</h1>
    <p class="date">Published: 21 October 2025</p>
    <p>This month, inspiration comes from everyday Aussies launching new digital products, reminding us all to get the basics right. As the government increases its focus on consumer protection, now is the perfect time to review your own digital responsibilities.</p>
    <h2>Key Updates for Your Business</h2>
    <ul><li>Review your privacy policy. Make sure your customers know what information you collect and why, as required by the Australian Privacy Principles. Being open and transparent about how you handle their data builds essential trust.</li><li>Check your website's accessibility. Your digital services must be usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. Use a free online tool to check for issues like poor colour contrast or missing image descriptions.</li><li>Be upfront with your customers. With big businesses under the microscope for their practices, clear and honest communication is your superpower. Ensure your pricing, terms, and contact details are easy to find and understand.</li><li>Protect the customer information you hold. Whether it's in a spreadsheet or a cloud service, you have a duty to protect personal data from misuse or loss. Regularly review who has access and use strong, unique passwords.</li></ul>
